For example, various laws and regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and National Institutes of Health guidelines for Protecting Participant Privacy when Sharing Scientific Data, strive to protect the privacy of the identities of individuals and their health-related data. As a possible solution within these regulatory requirements, the Harvard Data Commons, the Open Commons Consortium, the National Cancer Institute’s Genomic Data Commons, and other entities have developed public data access systems that curate and host health-related and other data for research and public policy decisions. This session will bring together experts in this arena to discuss key developments on balancing data privacy and access as well as the future of data access, with a goal of identifying the lessons learned that may across several domains and contexts.\n\n\n10:00am - 10:15am\nCoffee and tea break\n\n\n10:15am - 12:00pm\nSession 1: Government PETs Applications\n\n\n\nS1-01: Lisa B.
