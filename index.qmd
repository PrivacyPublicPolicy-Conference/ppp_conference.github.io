## Privacy and Public Policy Conference

The goal of this conference is to foster and enhance collaboration among privacy experts, researchers, data stewards, data practitioners, and public policymakers. This event serves as a crucial platform to bridge communication gaps across these diverse groups and collectively explore technical and policy solutions for addressing challenges related to data privacy and public policy.

## **Tentative Program Structure**

The Conference Committee is currently in the process of planning a two-day conference with a single-track format. The event will commence with an invited panel of speakers who will discuss the practical implementation of various data privacy laws before a series of speakers present based on submitted abstracts. In the evening, we are excited to host a poster session, complete with prizes for the best poster presentations. On the second day, following additional presentations, we will wrap up the event with engaging roundtable discussions.
